# One Prompt Challenge Winter 2025

`It's not the size of your model that counts, it's how you use it`

The participant has to create a working computer program from a single prompt. Then run the application and demonstrate its use. All this has to be recorded, so others can also see it. After demonstration, the code together with the prompt and other details has to be submitted as a GitHub Gist. The entry with the most GitHub stars wins!

To submit an entry to the challenge, post the link to the GitHub Gist on social media with the hashtag #onepromptchallenge. Our bots will pick this up and add it to a unified database. Supported social media sites: LinkedIn, Facebook, and X.

The current challenge will end at the end of Q1 2025. We'll collect results on April 1st at 00:00 UTC time. Winners will gain fame and glory as the champions of the first-ever one prompt challenge!

Winners will be announced here and also on the Venturing Intellect YouTube channel.

# Viewing Participants

# Recommendations

## Recording Demonstration
Be sure to include in the video how you execute the prompt and get a working application from this. This is a valuable learning opportunity for others.

For easy-to-use screen recording, use https://www.panopto.com/record-now/. It doesn't require installation or signup. Use the highest quality settings. It also has an "upload to YouTube" button – this requires authentication with a Google account.

Make sure your video is viewable by others (unlisted or public).

## Don't Know How to Code?

## Creating a Gist
Go to https://gist.github.com (needs a GitHub account)

Create a "!entry.md" file. (The `!` at the beginning makes this file the first one in the Gist)


Use this template
```
# Title of your application 
Demo video: <link to your video>

# Prompt
<your prompt used in the video>

# Prerequisites
<list any tools, libraries etc that need to be installed or downloaded to use the application>

# AI used
<ai model> - <date of use>

# One prompt challenge page
https://github.com/Venturing-Intellect/one-prompt-challenge
```

Then add all code files used, so interested parties can inspect the code.

# Example Entry
Here is our humble entry: https://gist.github.com/joosep-wm/b53c6a6715c88013f55a5b10553ac3f2
Another entry: https://gist.github.com/joosep-wm/9f1e86264a21eae6887b7e4c39f8d69f

Can you make something more awesome?

# Rules Fine Print
* Any tools and libraries can be used as long as these are listed.
* The demonstration video has to show how you use the AI tool and generate the program from the output.
* The assessment is done by other people by giving stars. The challenge organizers have no say in which entry is better. The count of GitHub stars is the verdict.
* Usage of agentic systems is allowed. Be sure to record how they operate. We will learn together how people will react to watching long-running agents working.

# Q&A
* **Q: Why are you doing this?**  
  **A:** We want to promote AI coding tools. This format helps good ideas (prompts) to be shared between people. Also, it's a good way to introduce new tools to people in a fun way.

* **Q: How can I learn better prompting?**
