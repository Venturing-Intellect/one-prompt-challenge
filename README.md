# One prompt challenge 2025

`It's not the size of your model that counts, it's how you use it`

Participant has to create a working computer program from single prompt. Then run the application and demonstrate it's use. All this has to be recorded, so other can also see it.
After demonstration, the code together with prompt and other details has to be submitted as Github gist. The entry with most Github stars wins!

To submit entry to challenge send the link to github gist to social media with hashtag `#onepromptchallenge`.
Our bots will pick this up and add to a unified database. Supported social media sites: Linkedin, Facebook and X.

Current challenge will end at the end of Q1 2025. We'll collect results at April 1st 00:00 UTC time.
Winners will gain fame and glory as the champions of first every one prompt challenge!

Winners will be announced here and also in Venturing Intellect YouTube channel.

# Recommendations

## Recording demonstration
Be sure to include in video how you execute the prompt and you get working application from this. This is valuable learning opportunity for others.

For easy to use screen recording use https://www.panopto.com/record-now/. It doesn't require installation, nor signup. Use highest quality settings. It also has "upload to YouTube" button - this requires authentication with Google account.

Make sure your video is viewable by others (unlisted or public).

## Creating Gist
Go to https://gist.github.com (needs GitHub account)

Create "!entry.md" file. (The ! at the beginning makes this file the first one in the Gist)

Use this template
```
# Title of your application 
Demo video: <link to your video>

# Prompt
<your prompt used in the video>

# Prerequisites
<list any tools, libraries etc that need to be installed or downloaded to use the application>

# AI used
<ai model> - <date of use>
```

Then add all code files used, so interested parties can inspect the code.

# Example entry
Here is our humble entry: https://gist.github.com/joosep-wm/b53c6a6715c88013f55a5b10553ac3f2

Can you make something more awesome?

# Rules fineprint
* Any tools and libraries can be used as long as these are listed.
* The demonstration video has to show how you use the AI tool and generate the program from the output.
* The assessment is done my other people by giving stars. The challenge organisers have no say in which entry is better. The count of github stars is the verdict.
* Usage of agentic system is allowed, be sure to record how they operate. We will learn together how people will react to watching long running agents working.

# Q&A
* Q: Why are you doing this?
* A: We want to promote AI coding tools. This format helps for good ideas to reproduce in peoples minds.
